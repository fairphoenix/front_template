        <h1>Antonio Gaudi</h1>
        <p>The voices of Barcelona blur in a mix of Spanish and Catalan in much the way Gaudi's work blurs the lines
            between architecture and artwork</p>
        <p>From the tiled benches in Guell Park to the towers over Casa Mila and Casa Battlo, I fell in love with
            Goudi's work on my firs trip to Barcelona.</p>

        <h1>Park Guell</h1>
        <p>The benches as Lizard fountain in Park Guell make up part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as, "The
            Works of Antonio Gaudi."</p>
        <p>The park features Gaudi's famous Lizad Fountain, as well as benches and other extraordinary examples of
            Gaudi's talent with tiles.</p>

        <h1>Casa Batllo</h1>
        <p>The firs time I strolled down the Passeig de Gracia (Catalan of the Promenade of Grace), I stopped in my
            rtacks in front of Gausi's Casa Batllo.</p>
        <p>The 'house,' wedged between two 'normal' buildings, look more like a gian sculpture then any house I'd ever
            seen anywhere else.</p>

        <h1>Cass Mila</h1>
        <p>A pupular attraction in Barcelona, Cassa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, is arguably one of the most famous
            buildings designed by Gaudi.</p>
        <p>The roof features a collection of chimneys adn towers that like thiy'd fit right in as characters in a
            Dr. Suess book.</p>
